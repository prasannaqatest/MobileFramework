Technology Stack used for theScore APP:

        The Score App is a Native App. I have created a zip File out of the .APK File and 
        inspected the extracted file. Based on my understanding, the below technology stack has been used 
              Front-end:
                 • Kotlin
                 • Java script
                 • HTML/CSS
                 
              Back-end:
                 • Google Firebase
                 
              Service-layer:
                • Rest-API 
                 
Kotlin: Kotlin is a an open source programming language for android Development that combines the object oriented programming.

Rest-API : It acts as a midlle layer between the Presentation layer and back-end. Any action that is performed
on the Presentation layer in turn calls the Service layer that is the Rest API where the actual logic lies.which 
in turn calls the back end layer.It fetches the information from the Back end and presents it to the user.
